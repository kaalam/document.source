<h2>A short Q&A: Why should you care about Jazz</h2>

In the [first kaalam post](/kaalam/xxx) we made some strong claims on current
limitations of AI frameworks and stated that Jazz is a step forward addressing these issues. Now, we want to look at all these claims
one by one. Even if you are very happy with you current framework, we want you to give some though to what things could be done
better on a different tool. We definitely do not expect you to replace your framework like you replace your car. We expect
curious early-adopters to explore the possibilities, build some success cases so we all gain some traction together. In the meantime,
all frameworks will evolve and some day a **community is built** that uses Jazz as their primary framework.

<h3>Q: But first, what is Jazz?</h3>

Before we continue, you need to understand what Jazz is. The introduction in these
[vision articles](/jazz_reference/basics_jazz_vision.html) is all you need to follow the rest of this discussion.
We tried to make it rigorous and short, the result may be too technical or assuming too much knowledge, sorry for that.

<h3>Q: You stated "current frameworks are a hindrance in the exploration of new ideas", isn't that too strong?</h3>

This statement is strong, but if you agree on most of (or even all) the following points, it becomes a consequence. Keep reading.

<h3>Q: "Reinforcement Learning", how is Jazz better suited for that?</h3>

<h3>Q: "Learning with something else than Gradient Descent", again, how?</h3>

Computer Go has been sold as a success of deep learning. It is a combination of MonteCarlo Tree Search and DNN. Without the DNN it is still
stronger than almost the whole human population and as strong as the best in 9x9. Without the Tree Search it just sucks, it becomes
a player that plays strong and elegant moves, but does not understand when to play them. A few mistakes and the game is over, just one
mistake against a professional player.

<h3>Q: "Exploring ideas with the right amount of data naturally." I can do that with, say, Tensorflow, so what?</h3>

This includes "Learning with something else than fully connected layers."

<h3>Q: "Semantics that do not make AI look stupid", didn't you just say you don't know how to do that?</h3>

Automatic programming.

<h3>Q: "Safe and automated ways to work with all kinds of data sources" aren't you overpromising here?</h3>

It is true that we have amazing free software tools to process all kinds of data. But, since we have not advanced much in persistent data abstractions since 1950 (yeah, the file was invented in 1950), it is hard for a machine to reason about how to apply these tools seamlessly. Creation of data pipelines is tedious and error prone.

<h3>Q: Why on earth do we need another language? Would xyz not have been a better choice?</h3>

<h3>Q: "Getting rid of scripting languages", why should that be an objective?</h3>

<h3>Q: "Scaling, creating APIs, ..." I can already do that, why move to a less established framework?</h3>

"The lightweight, single process, unlimited threads back-end that simply doesn't need anything else that itself."

"In the end, all you need is a box running Jazz and a browser."

<h3>Q: Jazz does not have security implemented, am I right?</h3>

<h3>Q: How reliable is Jazz?</h3>
