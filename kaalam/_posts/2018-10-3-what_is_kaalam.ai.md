<h2>What is kaalam.ai?</h2>


Kaalam, which is Filipino for **wisdom**, it is a meritocratic society created around the development and commercial deployment of Jazz and
Jazz-based services. It is not yet a corporation, not yet funded and not related to BBVA (the owner of Jazz 0.1.7) or any other organization.
The original author of Jazz is a co-founder at **kaalam.ai**.

If you are only interested in Jazz, this is probably all you need to know about **kaalam.ai** and you can safely skip the rest of this post.
We are open and eager to find people willing to be part of our project. We need help in all parts, including: coding, helping with communication,
creating Jazz projects, Jazz tutorials, giving feedback or just spreading the word. If you may be interested, you will probably want to know
more. This page is the **"Hello World!"** of the Jazz community.


<h3>The Mangrove Forest</h3>

The mangrove forest will be a recurrent theme in kaalam's brand. Trees that proudly show their roots and challenge the ocean extending lifeforms
out of their boundaries. It represents life and respect for Asia. When we invest in corporate brand, we will evolve the mangrove forest theme.
For now, we just use **one green mangrove leave** as the promise of a new life form finding its place.


<h3>Geekery</h3>

So far, 100% of kaalam's members are geeks. We envision coding as a super power. Code is a formal language so it teaches rigor. **kaalam**
has not yet spent a euro and it already has everything larger companies have to invest huge sums trying to build, everything built as code:
Infrastructure as code, communication as code, steering tools as code, machine learning models, an unpublished algorithm that deserved a
Kaggle medal in the Zillow price, a knowledge base, **an ambitious AI strategy** and a valuable code base: **Jazz**.

We believe managerial tasks should be kept simple, outsourced when possible and at the service of corporate goals and strategy. Strategy in
a scale-up aspiring to push over the edge is entangled with technical feasibility. We need the kind of rigor only a technical manager can
deliver. You probably do not expect the managing partner of law firm not to be a lawyer, but in tech companies the managing coder is an
exception. Well, **we are the exception**.

Don't take the building a "corporation of coders" too strictly. Of course, we need people to define UX, brand, marketing, regulation, sales
and everything else, but we want those people to understand how to deliver these things "as code". Meaning that it is something that can be:
created once/deployed many times, peer reviewed, tested, measured, continuously improved without restarting. Or, at least, people who want
to learn how to do that.

There is a world outside technology and we are part of it. We are committed in collaborating with social enterprises that can benefit from
our technology. We will build a transparent corporation that respects people, nature and law in terms you could feel proud when explaining
them to your children.

We aspire to become **responsible innovators**. We need money to deliver, money buys commitment when you already have vision, talent and
part of the product. Some day we will deliver products in exchange for money from our investors to create more money for all of us. After
all, **Jazz** was born in the financial sector.


<h3>No exclusion, no exceptions</h3>

One of the advantages of creating kaalam in **Spain** is we are not bound by exclusion rules that apply in many places like the US. We
have a **planetary focus**, we design for billions of users, if you happen to be born in Iran, Cuba, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, Crimea
or wherever, you are just perfect for us.


<h3>First bootstrapping, then funding</h3>

We believe in doing everything correctly, **first** proving that we can become a player capable of achieving major advances in AI, and
**then**, raising money. There is no substitute for doing. We want others to respect us for the same thing we respect others: **delivering**
**amazing technology**. We definitely believe in meritocracy, we need help, we want to find people that believe in the idea enough to
invest their time just for the sake of making it happen.

Premature funding, especially by incumbents, typically ends up replicating the incumbent's hierarchy. In such scenarios, budget ownership
replaces vision and ladder climbing skills replace merit. Of course, we don't know everything and we would accept funding that does not
imply diverging from our strategic goals. It's just that the risk of becoming "yet another you-name-it" prevents us from looking for the
shelter of a large corporation too early. Again, **not too early**! We definitely look forward to build alliances with major players. We
believe in going through a period of austerity that self-selects the team, builds the product and earns respect for the vision. After that,
alliances should be built, not for money but based common interests.

**Just to clarify**: This is compatible with crowdfunding Jazz-based products. At this stage, we are not looking for investors, but raising
donations and crowdfunding to make products happen by committing full time dedication of coders is part of the strategy.


<h3>Why OSS? A brief Q&A for people not familiar with Open Source Software</h3>

<h4>Q1: What if a non Jazz author ignores kaalam and builds her own Jazz company?</h4>

This is **legal** and even **good** for all of us. It places Jazz in the center of an ecosystem. We should not be afraid to compete. And
honestly, we would compete with an unfair advantage. **Free software is a little bit like Texas hold'em**. The six open source repositories
are the community cards, but there are thirty other private repositories that are our hole cards. You need all the cards to win hands. You
need the people who can not just answer what was done, but why it was done. You need the people who can deliver new features, better,
faster and understanding all the implications. **It is a business model.**

<h4>Q2: What if some author does not agree on how kaalam evolves and builds her own Jazz company?</h4>

Unlike in the previous case, she deeply understands the technology and the vision because she has been "in the trenches" for a long time.
**That's okay too**! Inevitably, there is always a decision to be made between getting a bigger part of a smaller thing or a smaller part
of a bigger thing. Incompatible visions better become different projects than eternal fights. And again, **the more the merrier**. But, of
course, when kaalam becomes a corporation we hope not to lose most of our talent.

<h4>Q3: What if the project never reaches the point where it can grow organically and the authors give up?</h4>

**That's a real problem!** Most projects don't make it. But also here **being OSS helps**: In an OSS project **you own everything you built
and everything everyone else built**. It's the magic of software, it multiplies endlessly. If you are thrilled about making it happen, if you
are tired of AI becoming yet another overhyped end-to-end deep learning model taken from the 10000 similar ideas you see in every conference,
if you are exceptional at what you do (whatever that is), **you should consider being part of Jazz**. It is an opportunity, you will have a
say on what has to be built for the advancement of AI.

Hopefully, this clarifies why we should not be in a hurry to raise money.
