<h4>The problem we solve</h4>
<p>This page is the short version on how we envision <b>Jazz</b> as a necessary platform to advance both <b>AI research</b> and deployment
of <b>AI in production</b>. A longer, but still understandable without a technical background, explanation on why it is needed, can be found in
<a href="/kaalam/2018/10/02/reviewing_the_motive.html"><b>the motive</b></a>. How <b>Jazz</b> solves the identified opportunities for
improvement over current platforms is discussed in <a href="/kaalam/2018/10/01/how_is_jazz_a_solution.html"><b>how is Jazz a solution</b></a>?</p>

<h4>Past and present</h4>
<p><b>Jazz</b> has been under development since end of 2016 although a narrow version of the current design. It was released as OSS by BBVA
in December 2017 and started its development towards new goals in the first quarter of 2018. You can also check the
<a href="/jazz_reference/basics_jazz_vision.html"><b>technical vision</b></a>, the
<a href="/jazz_reference/basics_jazz_today.html"><b>state of current development</b></a>
and the <a href="/develop_jazz02/index.html"><b>programmer's documentation</b></a> all of them updated continuously.</p>

<h4>How we plan to make it happen</h4>
<p><b>Jazz</b> is built as open source software by a group collectively know as <b>kaalam.ai</b>. The group has already being delivering Jazz
versions and documentation using automated integration during 2018. The first declaration of intentions is
this <a href="/kaalam/2018/10/03/what_is_kaalam_ai.html"><b>hello world</b></a>!</p>

<h4>And finally, the pitch!</h4>
<ul>
	<li>We are building Jazz because <b>we need Jazz</b>.</li>
	<li>We need Jazz because <b>there is nothing like Jazz</b> than we can use to build what we <b>need to build</b>.</li>
	<li>We are <b>not raising money</b> at this stage because we do not want a short term business plan steering the long term vision:
<b>building a platform that enables radically new ideas in AI</b>.</li>
</ul>
