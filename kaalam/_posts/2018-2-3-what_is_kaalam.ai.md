<h2>What is kaalam.ai?</h2>


Kaalam, which is Filipino for **wisdom**, it is a meritocratic society created around the development and commercial deployment of Jazz and Jazz-based services. It is not yet a corporation, not yet funded and not related to BBVA (the owner of Jazz 0.1.7) or any other organization. The original author of Jazz is a co-founder of <b>kaalam.ai</b>.

If you are only interested in Jazz, this is probably all you need to know about <b>kaalam.ai</b> and you can safely skip the rest of this post. We are open and eager to find people willing to be part of this collaborating in any part, including: coding, helping with communication, creating projects, tutorials, giving feedback or just spreading the word. If you may be interested, you will probably want to know more, this is our "hello world!".


<h3>The Mangrove Forest</h3>

The mangrove forest will be a recurrent theme in kaalam's brand. Trees that proudly show their roots and challenge the ocean extending lifeforms out of their boundaries. It represents life and respect for Asia. When we invest in corporate brand, we will evolve the mangrove forest theme. For now, we just use one green mangrove leave as the promise of a new life form finding its place.


<h3>Geekery</h3>

So far, 100% of kaalam's members are geeks. We envision coding as a super power. Code is a formal language so it teaches rigor. kaalam has not yet spent a euro and it already has pretty much everything larger companies have to invest a lot of money trying to build, everything built as code. Infrastructure as code, communication as code, steering tools as code, machine learning models, an unpublished algorithm that deserved a Kaggle medal in the Zillow price, and a valuable code base, Jazz. 

We believe managerial tasks should be kept simple, outsourced when possible and at the service of corporate goals and strategy. Strategy in a scale-up aspiring to push over the edge is entangled with technical feasibility. Non-technical managers necessarily sacrifice rigor and end up communicating a blurred message more influenced by trends and superficial comparison than facts. We probably do not expect the managing partner of law firm not to be a lawyer, but for some reason in tech companies the managing coder is an exception. Well, we are the exception.

Don't take the building a "corporation of coders" too strictly. Of course, we need people to define UX, brand, marketing, regulation, sales and everything else, but we want those people to understand how to deliver these things "as code". Meaning that it is something that can be: created once/deployed many times, peer reviewed, tested, measured, continuously improved without restarting. Or, at least, people who want to learn how to do that.

There is a world outside technology and we are part of it. We are committed in collaborating with social enterprises that can benefit from our technology. We will build a transparent corporation that respects people, nature and law in terms you could feel proud when explaining them to your children.

We aspire to become **responsible innovators**. We need money to deliver, money buys commitment when you already have vision, talent and part of the product. We deliver products in exchange for money from our stakeholders to create more money for all of us. After all, Jazz was born in the financial sector.


<h3>No exclusion, no exceptions</h3>

One of the advantages of creating kaalam in Spain is we are not bound by exclusion rules that apply in many places like the US. We have a planetary focus, we design for billions of users, if you happen to be born in Iran, Cuba, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, Crimea or wherever, you are just perfect for us.


<h3>First bootstrapping, then funding</h3>

We believe in doing everything correctly, proving we can become a player capable of achieving major advances in AI, and then, raising money is probably not going to be hard. We definitely believe in meritocracy, we need help, but want to find people that truly believe in the idea enough to invest their time just for the sake making it happen.
	
Premature funding, especially by incumbents, typically ends up replicating the incumbent's hierarchy. In such scenarios, budget ownership replaces vision and ladder climbing skills replace merit. Of course, there may be exceptional incumbents who have successfully innovated in "skunk works" mode, but the risk of the former scenario makes us not want the shelter of a large corporation too early.


<h3>Meritocracy and forking</h3>

Contributing gives you right to shared copyright holding, that's the law. What we build is free software, it means <b>everyone</b> can build on top of it. When  kaalam becomes a corporation, someone else may decide to ignore all of us and create her own fork, that is totally okay. You may want to be part of kaalam, or you may want to build your own corportae project or none at all. Let's just have a look at these options and try to explain why being part of it is probably the best for all.
