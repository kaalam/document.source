<h2>What is kaalam.ai?</h2>


Kaalam, which is Filipino for **wisdom**, it is a meritocratic society created around the development and commercial deployment of Jazz and Jazz-based services. It is not yet a corporation, not yet funded and not related to BBVA (the owner of Jazz 0.1.7) or any other organization. The original author of Jazz is a co-founder of <b>kaalam.ai</b>.

If you are only interested in Jazz, this is probably all you need to know about <b>kaalam.ai</b> and you can safely skip the rest of this post. We are open and eager to find people willing to be part of our project. We need help in all parts, including: coding, helping with communication, creating Jazz projects, Jazz tutorials, giving feedback or just spreading the word. If you may be interested, you will probably want to know more. This is our <b>"hello world!"</b>.


<h3>The Mangrove Forest</h3>

The mangrove forest will be a recurrent theme in kaalam's brand. Trees that proudly show their roots and challenge the ocean extending lifeforms out of their boundaries. It represents life and respect for Asia. When we invest in corporate brand, we will evolve the mangrove forest theme. For now, we just use one green mangrove leave as the promise of a new life form finding its place.


<h3>Geekery</h3>

So far, 100% of kaalam's members are geeks. We envision coding as a super power. Code is a formal language so it teaches rigor. <b>kaalam</b> has not yet spent a euro and it already has everything larger companies have to invest huge sums trying to build, everything built as code: Infrastructure as code, communication as code, steering tools as code, machine learning models, an unpublished algorithm that deserved a Kaggle medal in the Zillow price, a knowledge base, a strategy and a valuable code base: <b>Jazz</b>.

We believe managerial tasks should be kept simple, outsourced when possible and at the service of corporate goals and strategy. Strategy in a scale-up aspiring to push over the edge is entangled with technical feasibility. We need the kind of rigor only a technical manager can deliver. We probably do not expect the managing partner of law firm not to be a lawyer, but in tech companies the managing coder is an exception. Well, we are the exception.

Don't take the building a "corporation of coders" too strictly. Of course, we need people to define UX, brand, marketing, regulation, sales and everything else, but we want those people to understand how to deliver these things "as code". Meaning that it is something that can be: created once/deployed many times, peer reviewed, tested, measured, continuously improved without restarting. Or, at least, people who want to learn how to do that.

There is a world outside technology and we are part of it. We are committed in collaborating with social enterprises that can benefit from our technology. We will build a transparent corporation that respects people, nature and law in terms you could feel proud when explaining them to your children.

We aspire to become **responsible innovators**. We need money to deliver, money buys commitment when you already have vision, talent and part of the product. We deliver products in exchange for money from our investors to create more money for all of us. After all, Jazz was born in the financial sector.


<h3>No exclusion, no exceptions</h3>

One of the advantages of creating kaalam in <b>Spain</b> is we are not bound by exclusion rules that apply in many places like the US. We have a <b>planetary focus</b>, we design for billions of users, if you happen to be born in Iran, Cuba, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, Crimea or wherever, you are just perfect for us.


<h3>First bootstrapping, then funding</h3>

We believe in doing everything correctly, proving we can become a player capable of achieving major advances in AI, and then, raising money is probably not going to be hard. There is no substitute for doing. We want others to respect us for the same thing we respect others: delivering amazing technology. We definitely believe in meritocracy, we need help, but want to find people that truly believe in the idea enough to invest their time just for the sake making it happen.
	
Premature funding, especially by incumbents, typically ends up replicating the incumbent's hierarchy. In such scenarios, budget ownership replaces vision and ladder climbing skills replace merit. Of course, there may be exceptional incumbents who have successfully innovated in "skunk works" mode, but the risk of the former scenario makes us not want the shelter of a large corporation too early. Again, <b>not too early</b> we definitely look forward to build alliances with major players. We believe in going through a period of austerity that self-selects the team, builds the product and earns respect for the vision. After that, alliances can be built, not just for money but based of shared strategy, talent, experience and common interests.


<h3>Meritocracy and forking</h3>

Contributing to the code base gives you the right to shared copyright holding, that is fair and legal, but not nearly as important as being part of the project. Let me elaborate on that. What we build is free software, it means <b>everyone</b> can build on top of it. When  kaalam becomes a corporation, someone else may decide to ignore all of us and create her own fork, that is totally okay. You, hypothetical co-author, may want to be part of kaalam, or want to build your own corporate project, or none of that. Let's just have a look at these options.

<h4>Scenarios</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Someone else (a non Jazz author) ignores kaalam an builds his own Jazz company</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This is legal and even good for all of us. It places Jazz in the center of an ecosystem. We should not be afraid to compete. And honestly, we would compete with an unfair advantage. Free software is a little bit like Texas hold'em. The six open source repositories are the community cards, but there are thirty other private repositories that are our hole cards. You need all the cards to win hands. You need the people who can not just answer to what was done, but to why it was done. You need the people who can deliver new features, better and faster and understanding all the implications. It is a business model.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>You (a Jazz author) build your own Jazz company</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Unlike in the previous case, you deeply understand the technology and the vision because you have been "in the trenches" for a long time. You probably disagree with the corporate vision and think you can do better. Okay, that is a failure of all of us. Hopefully, when kaalam becomes a corporation we do not lose most of the talent. Inevitably, there is always a decision to be made between getting a bigger part of a smaller thing or a smaller part of a bigger thing. In a company  there is commitment, deadlines, shareholders and a hierarchy, accepting most of it and rowing in the same direction is essential. Incompatible visions better become different projects than eternal fights. And again, the more the merrier.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>We all build kaalam.ai together</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This is the optimal scenario. It requires a clear strategy that motivates three groups of stakeholders: founders, investors and new members. We want the company to be attractive to top talent and equity is the incentive that will create the kind of involvement we expect from all. It is an exercise of generosity, strategic resonance and commitment.</p>

Maybe, now it gets clear why we should not be in a hurry to raise money.
