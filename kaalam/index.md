We wish to thank [BBVA](https://www.bbva.com) and especially [BBVA Data & Analytics](https://www.bbvadata.com) where Jazz was originally created
for giving us the opportunity to build Jazz on top of their OSS Jazz 0.1.07 released in December 2017. BBVA is second to none in digital transformation in the financial sector and a place where award winning software is written every day.


We also wish to thank the whole OSS community, especially LMDB, CURL, MHD, Catch2!, SWIG, the Linux community (too many software engineering tools to list: for static and dynamic code analysis, CI & CD), the R community and the Python community used in the Jazz project.


And we finally wish to thank [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) for this website's template and [Andrew Banchich](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme) for its Jekyll automation available under a [CCA3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.
