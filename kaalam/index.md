Yesterday's breakthrough applications were driven by big data â€“ tomorrow's breakthrough applications will be driven by leveraging data with AI in
real-time to billions of users. A light-weight server including persistence, data collection, crunching with deep neural networks, APIs, web and
mobile all served by the same process is the only requirement to make it happen. Building on the shoulders of giants, free software and C++ makes
such integration possible. We present Jazz, a lightweight all-in-one analytical and AI server created from a code base donated by BBVA Data & Analytics.


*[AI]: Artificial Intelligence: In this case, we refer to technology enabling applications such as machine translation, image recognition, self driving and many more.
*[APIs]: Application Program Interfaces: In this case, client/server interfaces that allow clients (computers and smartphones) to communicate data with a server.
*[C++]: C++: An extension of the C computer language appeared in 1983 that is still today the language of use when efficiency is the main concern.
*[BBVA Data & Analytics]: BBVA Data & Analytics: A fully owned subsidiary of BBVA. It is BBVA's center of excellence for analytics and builds data engines for the eleven countries where BBVA is present.
