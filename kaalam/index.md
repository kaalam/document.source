We wish to thank [BBVA](https://www.bbva.com) and especially [BBVA Data & Analytics](https://www.bbvadata.com) where Jazz was originally created
for giving us the opportunity to build Jazz on top of their OSS Jazz 0.1.07 released in 2017. In the financial sector BBVA is second to none in 
digital transformation and betting on OSS shows that BBVA's mission "Creating Opportunities" is much more than just a sentence.


We also wish to thank the whole OSS community, especially LMDB, CURL, MHD, Catch2, SWIG, the R community, the Python community and tiny-dnn.


*[OSS]: Open Source Software
*[BBVA Data & Analytics]: BBVA Data & Analytics: A fully owned subsidiary of BBVA. It is BBVA's center of excellence for analytics and builds data engines for the eleven countries where BBVA is present.
