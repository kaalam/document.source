## Initial definition

In Jazz an **rvalue** is one of:

  * A block constructor. A constant expression that can be used to build a block from it.
  * Chains of keeprs abstracted as existing blocks starting from root. This includes functions and blocks passed as arguments to functions.
  * A combination of the previous two.
