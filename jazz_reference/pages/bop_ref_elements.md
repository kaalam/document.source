## About this page

{% include important.html content="This page is intentionally not called Bebop Reference, it is way too early for that. This is the place where details about the language will be described as implemented." %}

## The idea behind Bebop

<span class="label label-info">Bebop</span>

`Bebop` aka. `Bop` introduces a new kind abstraction, the [field](vision_bop_fields_contexts.html#introducing-fields). The definition of the language itself is stored in the fields (in plural) from which it inherits. And the language extends itself functionally. The result being that anything (any formal text, any natural text, but even data) could be Bop code in some field. The whole idea is introduced as [Jazz magic](vision_bop_fields_contexts.html#what-is-that-jazz-magic)

## Fundamental ideas

* [Bebop operates at source and bytecode level](vision_bop_fields_contexts.html#bebop-operates-at-source-and-bytecode-level)
* [Bebop is object oriented (in its own way)](vision_bop_fields_contexts.html#bebop-is-object-oriented-in-its-own-way)
* [Bebop is functional](vision_bop_fields_contexts.html#bebop-is-functional)
* [Bebop is safe](vision_bop_fields_contexts.html#bebop-is-safe)
* [Bebop forks](vision_bop_fields_contexts.html#bebop-forks)
* [Automatic function result caching](vision_bop_fields_contexts.html#automatic-function-result-caching)
