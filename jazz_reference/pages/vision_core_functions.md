## What are core functions?


## Deep Neural Networks

Where are all the **layer-types**, **activation functions** and **optimization algorithms**? If Jazz wants to become the primary framework
for a large community, they will have to be implemented. For a framework that still **has to build a community**, competing against TensorFlow
in what TF is best, is probably not the smartest move. If Jazz succeeds, we may have all these things in due time. The following is a list
of what is already implemented in **tiny-dnn** that could be used as a reference implementation.

### Open Source Bebop DL Libraries

Summarizing, Jazz would not be necessary if, like some people seem to think, AI is DL. Jazz is about providing efficient solutions to do
everything in AI, from which DL is just a part.

And once DL is written in Bebop, you get:

* **Automatic abstraction**: The same code works on small things or automatically paralleled on distributed dataframes.
* **Easy access to details**: You can experiment with variations without having to recompile a platform that requires months of dedication
to understand assuming you have the time and the skills. Or even automate that.
* **Efficiency**, **persistence**, a **production-level API** for your project, **error management**, result **caching**, integration with
other **AI** (tree search, RL, etc.), reading/writing to files in **common binary formats**, what else?
