Note that the url does not include the project folder where the file is stored. This is because the site uses permalinks, which pulls the topics out of subfolders and places them into the root directory when the site builds.

Now the page.url and the item.url can match and the `active` class can get applied. With the `active` class applied, the sidebar section remains open.

{% include links.html %}
