## We need volunteers!

{% include image.html file="volunteer_orig.png" caption="Join the team" %}

We need as much help as we can get with all kind of skills

  * C++ coders for Jazz server core development
  * R (possibly with C++) for advancing the R experience
  * Python (possibly with C++) for advancing the Python experience
  * Front-end coders to create web and mobile Jazz applications
  * UX experts at two levels: programming APIs and end-users
  * Writers and reviewers for documentation, tutorials and articles
  * Testers/evaluators/inventors to play with it, help fixing bugs and develop new ideas
  * Communicators to spread the word
  * Smart people to tell us what is missing in this list

## Three Simple Rules

{% include note.html content="Just **drop us a message**. We have not reached the size where we need filtering. We are very happy to hear
about you. Many procedures for generating things automatically exist, you may need to know that before you start." %}
{% include note.html content="**Nothing is carved in stone**. Instead of thinking about some of our choices as a deal breaker, ask us, you
may convince us to change it." %}
{% include note.html content="We will be more than happy to find people wanting to **take responsibility for areas** of the project. That
includes deciding what and how to do things." %}

**Summarizing**: contact us, contact us, <a href="mailto:kaalam@kaalam.ai">contact us</a>
and {% include inline_image.html file="be_part_of_it.png" alt="be part of it." %}

## What is the vision?

{% include callout.html content="The vision is building a platform to make advances in AI happen that are not straightforward using current
platforms." %}

  * The reasons **why** are described in [why Jazz](/kaalam/2018/10/04/why_jazz.html).
  * **What** our solution is, is described [here](basics_jazz_vision.html).
  * The "Hello world!" of the Jazz [community](/kaalam/2018/10/03/what_is_kaalam.ai.html).

## How do I make a contribution?

If it is a fix or simple feature to the Jazz repository and you know how to make a **pull request**. you can try that way. But still our
favorite method is: <a href="mailto:kaalam@kaalam.ai">contact us</a>.
