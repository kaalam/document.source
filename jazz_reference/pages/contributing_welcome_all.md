## We need volunteers!

{% include image.html file="volunteer_orig.png" caption="Join the team" %}

We need as much help as we can get with all kind of skills

  * C++ coders for Jazz server core development
  * Front-end coders to create web and mobile Jazz applications
  * UX experts at two levels: programming APIs and end-users
  * Writers and reviewers for documentation, tutorials and articles
  * Testers/evaluators/inventors to play with it, help fixing bugs and develop new ideas
  * Communicators to spread the word
  * Smart people to tell us what is missing in this list

## Three Simple Rules

{% include note.html content="Just **drop us a message**. We have not reached the size where we need filtering. We are very happy to hear
about you. Many procedures for generating things automatically exist, you may need to know that before you start." %}
{% include note.html content="**Nothing is carved in stone**. Instead of thinking about some of our choices as a deal breaker, ask us, you
may convince us to change it." %}
{% include note.html content="We will be more than happy to find people wanting to **take responsibility for areas** of the project. That
includes deciding what and how to do things." %}

**Summarizing**: contact us, contact us, <a href="mailto:kaalam@kaalam.ai">contact us</a>
and {% include inline_image.html file="be_part_of_it.png" alt="be part of it." %}

## What is the vision?

{% include callout.html content="The vision is building a platform to make advances in AI happen that are not straightforward using current
platforms." %}

  * A short pitch [why Jazz](/kaalam/2018/10/04/why_jazz.html).
  * Identifying improvement opportunities [the motive](/kaalam/2018/10/02/reviewing_the_motive.html).
  * How Jazz fits these opportunities [Jazz as a solution](/kaalam/2018/10/01/how_is_jazz_a_solution.html).
  * Technically speaking, what is the vision [here](vision_intro_page.html).
  * The "Hello world!" of the Jazz [community](/kaalam/2018/10/03/what_is_kaalam_ai.html).

## How do I make a contribution?

If it is a fix or simple feature to the Jazz repository and you know how to make a **pull request**. you can try that way. But still our
favorite method is: <a href="mailto:kaalam@kaalam.ai">contact us</a>.

## The **Hard Parts** of Open Source

<span class="label label-success">Recommended video on OSS dynamics</span>

**Evan Czaplicki**, the author of Elm, has already been tackling with OSS for seven years and gave this brilliant speech. We have not yet
reached the point of maturity where the Elm community is today, but there are some wonderful lessons that make us recommend watching it
attentively.

Just sketching a few ideas:

  * Building Jazz is, in the best case, going to be a long process.
  * Understanding OSS community dynamics and empathizing will help.
  * There are beautiful solutions (see **conversation flows** at '41) to improve focus and constructive discussion.
