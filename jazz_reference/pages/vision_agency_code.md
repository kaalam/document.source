## Our definition of Agency

{% include important.html content="Agency is work in progress. Now that Jazz 0.5.1 is released (October 2021), the next thing is `Bebop`
(Jazz 0.6.x). After that, comes the question on how to automate Bebop code generation. That will be Jazz 0.7.x and is what we refer to as
**agency**."%}

In our 2019 paper [formal fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14075), besides defining formal fields, there is an implementation on how to
actually automate code generation. It is done using MCTS (Monte-Carlo Tree Search) with some references to alphazero.

The ideas that we have for Jazz 0.7.x (2023, possibly) include how everything fits together and why lifelong learning is an essential part
of it. Stay tuned!
