## About alerts

Alerts are little warnings, info, or other messages that you have called out in special formatting. In order to use these alerts or callouts, reference the appropriate value stored in the alerts.yml file as described in the following sections.

## Blast a warning to users on every page

If you want to blast a warning to users on every page, add the alert or callout to the \_layouts/page.html page right below the frontmatter. Every page using the page layout (all, by default) will show this message.

{% include links.html %}
