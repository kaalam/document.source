change the name to the latter. Take this as **This is Jazz** but most of it is not implemented yet." %}


## From 20,000 feet:

Before a detailed introduction, in case you feel the need to put a label on Jazz or want to pitch it in 10 seconds, you may ask...

### Is it a distributed no-sql database, a language, an http server, a machine learning framework?

Jazz is a new kind of data product. It combines all these things and some others: a programming language that extends by learning, an automated creator of APIs while being **just one** extremely lightweight process. It is free software created on top of third party free software. It is written in C++, available through a REST API. The framework is Linux only, but, since it is an http back-end, Jazz consumers include all devices and operating systems. Jazz is designed for millions of users interacting concurrently with large clusters.

Now, let's explain the main ideas:
