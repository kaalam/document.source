{% include note.html content="By \"layout,\" I'm not referring to the layouts in \_layouts in the project files. I'm referring to special ways of presenting information on the same \"page\" layout." %}

## FAQ layout

See {{site.data.mydoc_urls.mydoc_faq.link}} for an example of the FAQ format, which follows an accordion, collapse/expand format. This code is from Bootstrap.

## Knowledgebase layout

See {{site.data.mydoc_urls.mydoc_kb_layout.link}} for a possible layout for knowledge base articles. This layout looks for pages containing specific tags.

## Shuffle layout

If you want a dynamic card layout that allows you to filter the cards, see {{site.data.mydoc_urls.mydoc_shuffle.link}}. This uses the Shuffle JS library.
