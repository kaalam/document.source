## The easy way: Latest Stable Server

  * [Jazz (LSS) Latest Stable Server](reference_docker_latest_server.html) - The latest stable server is available as a Docker image.


## The advanced way: Compiling Jazz (required for customizing)

  * [How Can I Compile Jazz?](using_compile.html) - Starting with Jazz by compiling everything from source.


## Jazz 0.5.3: The Tangle Server

{% include important.html content="A new Tangle server with the data updated to 2025 (The data repositories are already available on
github: https://github.com/kaalam/tng-data-*) will be release with Jazz 1.25.1 in Q2 2025. Wait for it if you can."%}

The last 0.5.x series version is the fist real world application of the modern Jazz versions. It contains **The Tangle**
a curated entangled dataset of English language.

In 40 Gb of text, it contains many important English datasets that can be navigated at high speed (millions of jumps per seconds
per thread) built on top of Jazz. It is the present and future of Jazz development. All the data provisioning processes are fully
automated.

It will be maintained and used as the base of **our language as code** approach to AI.

## What is complete? What is under development?

The diagram above is updated. As the release version is delivered, the modules will no longer show the release version.


## What is still refactoring from Jazz 0.5.x?

Nothing.


## What can I try out from the original Jazz 0.1.7?

You can run a Jazz 0.1.7 server (still implemented as legacy in Jazz 0.2.x) using Docker from Docker Hub.

```bash
docker run -p8888:8888 kaalam/jazz_neat:0.2.1.99
```

Check [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kaalam/jazz_neat/tags/) to find the name of the latest image.

Point a browser to http://localhost:8888/// to see if the server is running, you should get a page similar to

	Jazz

	 version : 0.1.07
	 build   : RELEASE
	 artifact: Ubuntu_04.1
	 myname  : Jazz1
	 sysname : Linux
	 hostname: j424x4
	 kernel  : 4.15.0-36-generic
	 sysvers : #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 24 16:19:09 UTC 2018
	 machine : x86_64

You can install the R package from CRAN ...

```R
install.packages('rjazz')
```

... and play with some example (Edit the line with set_jazz_host() as necessary.)
```R
set_jazz_host('127.0.0.1:8888')
page <- '<html>\n<body>\n<br/>Hello world!\n</body>\n</html>'
create_web_resource('my_test',
					'/my_test/hello.html',
					type_const[['BLOCKTYPE_RAW_MIME_HTML']],
					page)
# See http://127.0.0.1:8888/my_test/hello.html with a browser.

list_web_sources()
delete_web_source('my_test')
set_jazz_host(host)
```


## A real world use of Jazz as an http server

The manual you are just reading, Jazz's developer's website, kaalam's website, the package reference and more are developed using Jazz
as the development server. You can find the source code of the automation on github.

{% include note.html content="The website automation is intended of internal use even if it is OSS. There is no support for it, but if
you feel comfortable with R, you can probably make it work or ping the author." %}
