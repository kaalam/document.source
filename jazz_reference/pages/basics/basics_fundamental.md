## Introducing Blocks

### A Block is a tensor

Jekyll runs on Ruby, a programming language. You have to have Ruby on your computer in order to run Ruby-based programs like Jekyll. Ruby is installed on the Mac by default, but you must add it to Windows.

### A Block has attributes

Jekyll runs on Ruby, a programming language. You have to have Ruby on your computer in order to run Ruby-based programs like Jekyll. Ruby is installed on the Mac by default, but you must add it to Windows.

### A Block has an owner

Also a block is binary moveable, quasi-immutable and has an owner. This means it can be copied "as is" because it has no pointers, it
is okay to treat it as immutable, Bebop does. Of course, in C++ you can still change its content, but you should have a good reason to do it
and provide and interface that abstracts that out so that it can be "thought of" as immutable. This avoids the burden of having to reallocate
RAM when you change attributes or strings, you can just create a copy of it with the new strings. According to the owner, a block can be
"one shot", "volatile" or "persisted". "One shot" is possible only in C++ and it means the creator owns the pointer to the block. A block
will be volatile or persisted depending on the class of the object that contains it.
